# A Deep Network DeepOpacityNet for Detection of Cataracts from Color Fundus Photographs
This repository provides scripts, test image samples, and attention map samples for the paper titled 'A Deep Network DeepOpacityNet for Detection of Cataracts from Color Fundus Photographs'.

## Instructions to set up
### Prerequisites
Have python 3.8, tensorflow 2.3, keras 2.4 installed locally.

### Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ncbi/DeepOpacityNet.git
cd DeepOpacityNet
```

### Create a virtual environment
```
python3.8 -m venv deepopacitynet

source deepopacitynet/bin/activate 
```

### Preprocessing
We provided our custom code to preprocesss color fundus photos with sample examples in the "Preprocessing" folder.

### The trained models
You can access the trained DeepOpacityNet as well as transfer-learning based models from the "Models" folder. These models were trained on our development (i.e., internal) dataset. Also, we provided the codes used to develop these models in the "Scripts" folder.

### Sample images
We included the subset of the test set as sample preprocessed images. This subset was used for the subjective grading in our study.


### Run the script
```
python classify_data.py --model_folder=Models --image_folder=CFP --output_file=predictions.csv
```
Please note that models and images are provided in the repository


### Check the output file
Compare predictions.csv with deepopacitynet_predictions.csv. If they are the same, it is ready for testing other images.

## Heatmpas of sample images
The samples can be accessed from 'CFP' folder.
